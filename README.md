# EEE4120F_YODA_Project
Binary coded decimal converter implemented on an FPGA.

- Golden_Measure.cpp: Golden Measure in C++.
- bcdc.py: BCDC script in Python to check correctness.
- BCDC_test: Implements a BCDC algorithm in Verilog, tests that it works on the FPGA by displaying the result on a seven segment display.
- BCDC_benchmark: Implements multiple BCD_Encoder modules to be used in functional simulations for benchmarking.
