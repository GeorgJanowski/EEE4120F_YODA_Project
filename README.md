# EEE4120F_YODA_Project
Binary coded decimal converter implemented on an FPGA.

Golden_Measure.cpp: Golden Measure in C++
bcdc.py: BCDC script in Python to check correctness
BCDC_test: Implements of BCDC algorithm on FPGA and verifies that it works by displaying the result to a seven segment display.
BCDC_benchmark: Implements multiple BCD_Encoder modules to be used in functional simulations for benchmarking.
